# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains several small Python projects to demonstrate basic Python programming skills. The current project is a **Multi-player Dice Rolling Game** that can be played by 2 to 4 players. Players take turns rolling dice and accumulate points, with exciting bonus rolls if they roll a six!

## Dice Rolling Game

### Description
This is a simple, interactive multi-player dice rolling game written in Python. The game allows players to roll a dice and accumulate points. The first player to reach 20 points wins! Additionally, if a player rolls a six, they are allowed to roll again for a bonus, adding to the excitement.

### Features
- **Multi-player support**: Play with 2 to 4 players.
- **Dice faces displayed**: Custom ASCII art is shown for each dice roll.
- **Bonus rolls**: Rolling a six gives players an extra roll for more points.
- **Game flow**: Players alternate turns and accumulate points. The game ends when one player reaches the target score of 20.
