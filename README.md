## 🎲 Multi-Player Dice Rolling Game

### Overview:
This is a **multi-player dice-rolling game** where players take turns rolling dice. The first player to reach **50 points** wins the game! You can roll the dice or skip your turn, but if you roll a `1`, your turn ends and you lose points.

### Features:
- Supports **2-4 players**.
- Players accumulate points based on dice rolls.
- Special rule: **roll a "1"** and lose all points for the round.
- The first player to **50 points** wins!
- Option to **skip your turn**.

### 🛠️ Installation:
No installation required. Simply run the script:

python dice_game.py

### 🎮 How to Play:

1. Enter the number of players (between 2 and 4).
2. Roll the dice or skip your turn.
3. Accumulate points based on the dice roll, but be cautious—if you roll a **"1"**, you lose all points for the round!
4. The first player to **50 points** wins the game!



### 📝 To-Do List App
